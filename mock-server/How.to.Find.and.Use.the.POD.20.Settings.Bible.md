One option is to look for a used copy online. You can try some used book search engines or online marketplaces to see if anyone is selling it. However, this might be difficult and expensive, as the book is rare and out of print.
 
Another option is to use the online tones from the Line 6 website. You can browse and download thousands of tones created by other users or by Line 6 experts. You can also use the Line 6 Edit program to view and edit the tones on your computer. This way, you can see what settings are being used for each tone and tweak them to fit your gear and preferences.
 
To use the online tones and the Line 6 Edit program, you will need a MIDI to USB adapter, such as the M-Audio Uno. This cable will allow your POD 2.0 to communicate with your computer. You will also need to install the Line 6 Edit software and the Line 6 Monkey software on your computer. You can find them on the Line 6 website.
 
Once you have everything set up, you can connect your POD 2.0 to your computer and launch the Line 6 Edit program. You can then import tones from your computer or from the Line 6 website into the program. You can also save tones from your POD 2.0 to your computer or upload them to the Line 6 website.
 
The Line 6 Edit program will show you a graphical representation of your POD 2.0, with all the knobs and switches that you can adjust. You can also see what amp model and effects are being used for each tone. You can change any parameter by clicking and dragging on the screen or by using your mouse wheel.
 
By using the online tones and the Line 6 Edit program, you can learn from other users and create your own tones easily. You can also share your tones with others and get feedback. This way, you can get the most out of your POD 2.0 without needing the POD 2.0 Settings Bible.
 
If you still want to find the POD 2.0 Settings Bible, you can try contacting Licklibrary or searching for it online. However, you might find that using the online tones and the Line 6 Edit program is more convenient and effective.
