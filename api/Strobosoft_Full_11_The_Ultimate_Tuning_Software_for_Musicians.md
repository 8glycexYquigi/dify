Strobosoft Full 11 is based on Peterson's 55+ years of tuning experience and innovation. Peterson Strobe Tuners are the industry standard for professional musicians, studios, schools and instrument manufacturers. They are known for their unparalleled accuracy, reliability and quality. Peterson's strobe tuning technology is based on the principle of comparing a musical note to a reference frequency that is displayed as a moving pattern on a circular screen. When the note is in tune, the pattern stops moving. This allows you to see even the slightest deviation from the desired pitch and adjust accordingly.
 
Strobosoft Full 11 also offers a unique feature called Sweetened Tunings, which are exclusive to Peterson tuners. Sweetened Tunings are preset temperaments that are designed to make your instrument sound more harmonious and musical. They are based on the specific characteristics and intonation of each instrument, and take into account factors such as string gauge, fret wear, playing style and more. Sweetened Tunings can make your instrument sound more in tune with itself and with other instruments, and can enhance your overall tone and expression.
 
Strobosoft Full 11 is compatible with a wide range of instruments, such as guitars, basses, keyboards, woodwinds, brass, strings, percussion and more. You can also create your own custom tunings and presets for any instrument or tuning system. Strobosoft Full 11 supports MIDI input and output, so you can use it with MIDI controllers and synthesizers. You can also use Strobosoft Full 11 to calibrate your audio interface or sound card, and to measure the frequency of any sound source.
