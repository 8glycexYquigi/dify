# Pharmacognosy: An Overview of Natural Sources of Drugs
 
Pharmacognosy is a branch of science that deals with crude drugs obtained from natural sources, such as plants, animals, minerals, marine organisms and microorganisms. It covers various aspects of the history, distribution, cultivation, collection, preparation, identification, evaluation, preservation and uses of crude drugs and their derivatives. The word 'pharmacognosy' was coined by a German scientist C. A. Seydler in 1815 in the title of his work "Analecta Pharmacognostica".

Pharmacognosy has a long history that can be traced back to the primitive era when humans used parts of plants and animals for healing, eliminating pain, controlling suffering and treating diseases. The knowledge of pharmacognosy was transferred by mouth and later on by carving on stones and clays and then writing on parchment or paper. In the pre-Christian era, many civilizations developed their own systems of medicine using natural products, such as Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, Egyptian medicine and Greek medicine. The works of Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Galen, Paracelsus and others contributed to the development of pharmacognosy in this era.
 
In the era after Christ, pharmacognosy witnessed rapid growth and development along with other branches of science and the emergence of modern techniques for plant drugs. During this era, many important plant drugs were isolated and identified, such as morphine from opium, quinine from cinchona bark, digitoxin from foxglove and vincristine from periwinkle. Pharmacognosy also played a key role in the discovery of antibiotics, such as penicillin and streptomycin.
 
In the modern era, pharmacognosy is still an important branch of pharmacy that is involved in new drug discovery and development using natural products. Pharmacognosy also provides a link between pharmacology and medicinal chemistry by studying the structure-activity relationships of natural compounds. Pharmacognosy also helps in the cultivation, processing and standardization of medicinal plants by applying the knowledge of plant taxonomy, plant breeding, plant pathology and plant genetics.
 
Pharmacognosy can be classified into different categories based on different criteria, such as alphabetical, morphological, pharmacological, chemical, taxonomical and chemotaxonomical methods. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages and can be used for different purposes. For example, alphabetical classification is simple and easy to remember but does not reflect any biological or chemical relationship among crude drugs. Morphological classification is based on the shape and structure of crude drugs but does not indicate their chemical or pharmacological properties. Pharmacological classification is based on the therapeutic effects or actions of crude drugs but does not show their chemical composition or structure. Chemical classification is based on the chemical constituents or groups present in crude drugs but does not reveal their biological origin or activity. Taxonomical classification is based on the botanical or zoological classification of crude drugs but does not consider their chemical or pharmacological aspects. Chemotaxonomical classification is based on the chemical markers or biosynthetic pathways of crude drugs but does not account for their morphological or pharmacological features.
 
Pharmacognosy also involves the cultivation, collection, processing, drying and storage of medicinal plants. These processes are influenced by various factors, such as soil type, climate, season, harvesting time, drying methods and storage conditions. These factors affect the quality and quantity of active constituents present in medicinal plants and hence their therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, good agricultural practices (GAP) are essential for obtaining improved cultivation of medicinal plants. GAP include strategies such as selecting suitable varieties of plants, using organic fertilizers and pesticides, maintaining proper irrigation and drainage systems, avoiding over-harvesting or under-harvesting of plants, applying appropriate drying techniques and storing plants in suitable containers.
 
Pharmacognosy also deals with the adulteration and evaluation of crude drugs. Adulteration is the deliberate addition of foreign substances or inferior materials to crude drugs to increase their weight or volume or to enhance their appearance or value. Adulteration can affect the quality and safety of crude drugs and hence their therapeutic effects. Therefore,
